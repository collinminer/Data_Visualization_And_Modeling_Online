    "\n",
    "**Source:** [Kaggle - Car Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prince7489/car-price-prediction-dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collection Method:** This dataset contains information about used cars collected from various automotive marketplaces and dealerships. It includes vehicle specifications, condition metrics, and pricing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features in the Data:**\n",
    "- **Brand/Make:** The manufacturer of the vehicle\n",
    "- **Model:** Specific car model name\n",
    "- **Year:** Manufacturing year\n",
    "- **Price:** Selling price in USD\n",
    "- **Mileage:** Total miles driven\n",
    "- **Fuel Type:** Gasoline, Diesel, Electric, Hybrid\n",
    "- **Transmission:** Manual or Automatic\n",
    "- **Engine Size:** Engine displacement\n",
    "- **Condition/Rating:** Overall vehicle condition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Dataset Interests Me:** Understanding what factors drive car prices is relevant to anyone buying or selling a vehicle. As someone who may purchase a used car in the future, I'm curious to see which features have the biggest impact on price - is it the brand, the age, the mileage, or something else? This analysis could provide practical insights for making informed purchasing decisions."
